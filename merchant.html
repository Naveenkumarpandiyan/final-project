        The Merchant of Venice is a play by William Shakespeare,
        believed to have been written between 1596 and 1598. A merchant in Venice named Antonio defaults on a large loan taken out on behalf of his dear friend, Bassanio, and provided by a Jewish moneylender,
         Shylock, with seemingly inevitable fatal consequences.
